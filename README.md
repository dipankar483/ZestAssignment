 1. com.zest.constants: contains all the xpath details.

      *******************************************************
 
 Certian things are there which I think it's better to called out before reviewing. It includes:
 1. Facebook details like User and password are dummy.
 2. We can improve more on Facebook post message automation by **handing the pop-up which is intermittent**.
 
 Add ons: I've automated few scenarios on the 1st assignment, but due to **time crunch it's half way** done till fetching the price from Amazon website and the 3rd assingment is also doable ! 
 
 Thanks !!
